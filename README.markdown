*This is an obsolete project*

This was my entry into the AppFog OpenStack Birthday Contest, a celebration of [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack)'s birthday that challenged developers to build an [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/) app that outputs the phrase "Happy Birthday OpenStack" in silly or roundabout ways.

I started with the Russian string "В советской России OpenStack желает вам «с днем рождения»", used [Micosoft's Translation API](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/dev/) to translate the phrase into English, performed a [Soviet inversion](http://sovietinversion.com/), and output the resulting string "Happy Birthday OpenStack".
